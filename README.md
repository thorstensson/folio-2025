# Portfolio, first push

Repo for my upcoming portfolio. This is early work in progress; a 'full' folio arrives early April. For the early April release, expect to see sections: Home, Work, Photography, and Contact. Later on in April, there will also come a blog session, where I will write about just about anything: code, life, art.

Toolbox: VSCode, GraphQL, Hygraph, Nuxt, Pixi 8, Lenis, GSAP.

To fork this, please remix and redesign.

I will be back. :penguin:
